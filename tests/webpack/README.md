# Webpack Example

This folder demonstrates that the generated `BUILD` file for
`@yarn_modules` contains a `node_binary` rule for the webpack module
executable.  It tests that the target is callable and that the help
message is output.

Webpack is a fairly complex dependency that contains a cycle in
`es5-ext`, `es6-iterator`, `es6-symbol`, `d` dependency cluster.  It
breaks this strongly connected component into a separate pseudo
`node_module`.

```sh
# Should be able to run webpack directly
$ bazel run @yarn_modules//:webpack_bin -- --help

# Should be able to invoke webpack as standalone script 
$ ./bazel-bin/external/yarn_modules/webpack_bin --help

# Should be able to execute webpack as part of a genrule
$ bazel build :webpack_compile

# Should be able to invoke another (contrived) genrule
$ bazel build :compile
```
